# obsidian_paperpile
My quest towards making taking/reviewing notes from science papers as painless as possible.

In Obsidian, create a new note in main notes vault (leave name Untitled.md unchanged). Paste in bibtex info with cmd+B from selected paper in paperpile. Save, run code. Obviously, folders will have to be tweaked into user's setup. I have a separate folder called /Paper notes/ into which the processed file is moved after renaming (firstauthor et al year title). The code generates independent pages for each author, and formats keywords as provided by the authors into #compund_tags.
